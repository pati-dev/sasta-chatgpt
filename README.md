# sasta-chatgpt
Locally hosted ChatGPT using GPT-4 API to avoid the monthly subscription.

This repo explores the capabilities of ClosedAI's GPT-4 model using the API access. The project has been appropriately named as ain't nobody got $20 to spare.  At the moment, the project uses Flask to host a webpage locally that uses a python script under the hood that reads user's question, calls the GPT-4 API, and returns the model's response on the webpage.
